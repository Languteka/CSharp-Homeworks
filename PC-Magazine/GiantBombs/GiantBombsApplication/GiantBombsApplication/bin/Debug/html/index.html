                <h2>Farmer</h2>
                <p>Meet the Farmer!

Name: Oppa (that’s not his real name...but that’s what everyone in Gangnamland calls him. Ancient prophecies say it means “Elder”, which shouled be “Big bro” in modern times) 

Age: You can earn a medal if you guess right...

Character: People say he’s got some bad personality issues. Apparently he has his share of insecurities too and was born with really small eyes which is why he wear sunglasses all the time...That or he’s just showing off his SWAG (Super Wonderful Ace Gestures)

Additional info: Apparently he is a pro when it comes to performing the national folklore dance in Gangnamland, called “Gangnam Style”. The dance was first introduced in 1012 by the demigod PSY. For some unknown reason the dance is accompanied by the phrase “Heeeey Sexy Lady!”</p>

                <h2>Mine</h2>
                <p>Description: Oh, look at all that salt! Isn’t it wonderful? The exact thing to make farmers set their cattle up against each other. But really....that’d be silly, wouldn’t it?

Rarity: EXTREMELY RARE   (....didn’t you get it already?)

Additional info: It’s a salt mine...what else do you need to know?!

<strong>Cost: 6$</strong></p>

                <h2>OP</h2>
                <p>Ah, you think darkness is your ally? OP merely adopted the dark. It was born in it, molded by it. It didn’t see the light until it was already a big chiken, by then it was nothing to it but blinding!

….
That sounded familiar.

Anyways, the OP is the main defender on the farm. It’s duty is to shoot down those annoying GGs (pigs with explosives...not the KPOP group <strong>Girl’s Generation</strong>) which attack the mines. 

It’s weapon of choice is the good ol’ rifle. 
Wait...is it safe to give a gun to a chicken?</br>

<strong>Cost: 1$</strong></p>

                <h2>GG</h2>
                <p>Stands for <strong>Girl’s Generation</strong>, the awesomest, most cutest Korean POP band EVER!!!
….
Wait....? What?
Oh, so apparently this is a different GG. According to my cat senses it stands for “гуцита с гърмелка”. What language is that?! Even Google Translate doesn’t recognize it....
Well...GG looks like a pig with explosives on it’s back so let’s just say GG is just that.
….
How does that bomb even stand on its back like that?!

Apparently it's the farmers' main attacker...</br>

<strong> Cost: 7$</strong></p>

                <h2>Bomb</h2>
                <p>Description: Probably the worst birthday present...so that makes it the best thing to give your neighbor; especially if you are so desperately fighting over salt mines with only your cattle.
Additional info: Please note, that such bombs need to be well camouflaged if you are going to throw them at your farmer-neighbors. Be creative...add a polka-dotted bow on it, it stands for “I love you, dear neighbor. Now please die and give me that salt mine.”
                    </br>
<strong>Cost: 10$ for radius 1</strong>
                    </br>
<strong>Cost for +1 radius: 10$</strong></p>
